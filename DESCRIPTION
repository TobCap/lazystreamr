Description:
  This package provides basic functions that handle lazy stream objects.
  Function names start with `l` and the remaining letters are from Haskell's
  function name with a few exceptions.
  The structure and coding mainly comes from Scheme and Haskell.
  It is now unavoidable that the very long lazy stream causes stack-overflow
  because R does not have tail call optimization for tail recursion.
